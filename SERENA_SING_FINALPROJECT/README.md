FINAL PROJECT DESCRIPTION

I have made a rock paper scissors game. It is against the computer. The user can choose the amount of rounds and whether they will play rock, paper, or scissors.
Once all rounds are played, the result of whether you won or lost is displayed.

- Input devices used: button (open game) and ultrasonic sensor (when close enough, will play your move)
- Output devices used: buzzer (sound when lose) and LEDS (whether program is open or closed)
