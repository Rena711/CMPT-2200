PROJECT 1 DESCRIPTION 01/02/2022

My application is called “Your 24/7 Food Picker”. It helps the user to decide what to make to eat from 
breakfast, lunch to dinner.

The user may enter the ingredients they have in the checkbox and the available food options will 
show. This is an optional feature. Food options will show regardless of whether any ingredients were 
picked. They can then choose from the food options, and it will show the recipe for how to make it in 
a message box. 

Afterwards they also have the option to share their suggestions in the entry box at the bottom of the 
screen where they can add multiple suggestions. There is also a help button and info button for if they 
are confused.

Widgets used:
- Label for title and others
- Button for OK and others
- Entry for users suggestions
- Radio button for breakfast, lunch or dinner
- Checkbox for ingredients
- Canvas for background images
- Message box for recipes and others
- Frames to organise windo
